Hi team,

The index/news pages are currently independent. It would be good to refactor them to inherit a common template.
See the below articles for help:
 - https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-make-a-web-application-using-flask-in-python-3
 - https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.10.x/templates/#template-inheritance

 Ideally we would have everything except the main content area in a "base.html" and then just override that in index/news.
 Also we'll need a block for the <title>.

 No rush!
