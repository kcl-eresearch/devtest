Hello,

I am emailing about the Research Portal's news article indicating the end of year party will be held in room 22.
This is no longer the case due to the chemical spill.
It will now be held in, the less secret, room 23.
Please change the news article ASAP as I do not want staff going to room 22.

Many thanks,
Event organiser
